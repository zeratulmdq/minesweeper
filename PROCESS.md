# DEVIGET coding challenge

### 9:30Hs
I spent 1 hour to think about the problem. 4 hours left.

### 10:30Hs 
Created the project. First push.

### 11:40Hs
Created models, migrations, api routes, GameController and GameRequest.

There is only one working endpoints so far:
```bash
# POST /games
To create a new game. I prefer to return the created instance to avoid another hit to the API. It could have been a link to the resource as well.
```
